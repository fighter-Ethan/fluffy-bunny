## Version 1.0.0
Release 1.0.0 is the launch of Fluffy Bunny! Included in this version is:

- A help command with a user-friendly interface
- A support command to take the user directly to the support discord server, Freedom Scripting Bots
- An invite command to allow the user to invite Fluffy Bunny to their own servers
- The play command, with rock, paper, and scissors currently programmed in!

There are a myriad of features planned for Version 1.1.0! Expect it soon. If there is an update such as 1.0.x, then that is either me cleaning up the code or fixing bugs. I'll document this!

Sincerely,
### fighter_Ethan@4051, Creator and Founder of Freedom Scripting Bots
